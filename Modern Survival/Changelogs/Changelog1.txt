Thoughts:
Overall I Haven't done much in Networking development this update but added some new mechanics. Some of the
things i'm proud of accomplishing is: Converting all projectile weapon classes the a hybrid of RayCasting and Physical
Projectile, Implemented a character with animations( walk, run, crouch/walk, and idle ), and Modeled and Textured a
new shotgun, this is a replacement for the old non effecient one)
